### 1.1 Before You Start
> "Statistics starts with a problem, proceeds with the collection of data, continues with the data analysis and finishes with conclusions" - Julian J. Faraway

As with many endeavors don't sump ahead without understanding what you are trying to solve.

**To formulate the problem correctly:**
1. Understand the physical background.
2. Understand the objective.
3. Make sure you know what the client wants.
4. Put the problem into statiscal terms.

**Understand how the data were collected:**
1. Are the data observational or experimental?
2. Is there nonresponse?
3. Are ther missing values?
4. How are the data coded?
5. What are the units of measurement?
6. Beware of data entry errors and other corruption of data.
### 1.2 Initial Data Analysis

It is very important to explore the data in question to get an understanding of it. 
**Numerical Summaries:**
- Means
- Standard Deviations
- Maximum
- Minimum

**Graphical Summaries:**
- Boxplots
- Histograms
- Density plots
- Scatter plots

Cleaning data often takes more time than the data anlaysis itself.
