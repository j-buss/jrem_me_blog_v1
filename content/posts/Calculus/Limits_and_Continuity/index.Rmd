The following are my personal notes from relearning calculus using the following resources:

- [Khan Academy AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc)
- [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)
taking the online class: [Introduction to Linear Algebra - MIT OCW 18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm)

## Strategy to Find Limits

- $\frac{0}{0}$ is much different than $\frac{b}{0}$
- Squeeze Theorem - Alternate Names:
  1. Pinching Theorem
  2. Sandwich Theorem
  3. Two officers and a drunk theorem
- Squeeze Theorem (formula): Let $I$ be an interval having the point $a$ as a limit point. Let $g$, $f$, $h$ be functions defined in $I$, except possibly at $a$ itself. Suppose that for every $x$ in $I$ not equal to $a$, we have: 

  - $g(x) \le f(x) \le h(x)$ 
  - and also suppose that 
  - $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \rarr a} g(x)=\lim_{x \rarr a} h(x) = L}$
  - Then $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \rarr a} f(x)= L}$
