The following are my personal notes from taking the online class: [Introduction to Linear Algebra - MIT OCW 18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm)

## 3.1 Spaces of Vectors

- The space $\R^n$ consists of all column vectors $v$ with $n$ components
- If $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ are in the vector space $S$ every combination $c\mathbf{v} + d\mathbf{w}$ must be in $S$; $\forall c,d \in \R$
- A subspace is a vector space inside of another vector space
- A subspace of a vector space is a set of vectors (including $\mathbf{0}$) that satisfies 2 requirements: If $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ are vectors in the subspace and $c$ is any scalar then:
  1. $\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}$ is in the subspace
  2. $c\mathbf{v}$ is in the subspace
- A subspace is closed under addition and scalar multiplication
- All subspaces of $\R^3$
  - **L** Any line through (0,0,0)
  - **P** Any plane through (0,0,0)
  - **Z** The single vector (0,0,0)
  - **$\R^3$** The whole space
- The Column Space of $A$ contains all linear combinations of the columns of $A$. 
- $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ can be solved when $\mathbf{b}$ is in the column space $\mathbf{C}(A)$
- If there are 2 subspaces, for example **P** and **L**, then the union $P \cup L$ is not a subspace
- If there are 2 subspaces, for example **P** and **L**, then the intersection $P \cap L$ is a subspace  
- If $A$ is a matrix with dimensions $m \times n$ then the column space $\mathbf{C}(A)$ is a subspace of $\R^m$

  
## 3.2 The Nullspace of A: Solving $A\mathbf{x} = 0$ and $R\mathbf{x}=0$

- The Nullspace $N(A)$ consists of all solutions to $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$. These vectors $\mathbf{x}$ are in $\R^n$ (i.e. for the matrix $A$ that has dimensions $m \times n$ this is the number of columns of $A$)
- Using elimination from $A$ to $U$ to $R$ doesn't change the nullspace; in other words $N(A)=N(U)=N(R)$
- Reduced Row Echelon Form $R = \text{rref}(A)$ has all pivots = 1, with zeros above and below
- rref continues elimination from the upper triangular matrix $U$ by doing two more steps:
  1. Use pivot rows to eliminate upware in $R$
  2. Divide the whole pivot row by its pivot
- Rank ($r$): is the number of pivots or number of nonzero rows in $R$; there are $n-r$ free columns
- If the column $j$ of $R$ is free (no pivot), there is a **special solution** to $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ with $x_j=1$
- Every matrix with $m<n$ has nonzero solutions to $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ in its nullspace
- 2 ways to tell about a subspace:
  1. Given a few vectors make combinations and "build it up"
  2. Given a few equations that need to be satisfied
- When solving with elimination ($A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$) we are not changing the $\mathbf{0}$ vector and therefore not changing the nullspace, but we are changing the column space
- Steps to finding solutions to ($A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$):
  1. Reduce $A$ to its rref $R$
  2. Find the special solutions to $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$
- The Nullspace contains all linear combinations of the special solutions
- There are 1 special solutions for each free variable
- rref has Identity in pivot rows/columns
- Thinking of the Nullspace solutions in block form:

$$
\begin{align*}
R &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
I & F\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\\
N &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
-F\\
I
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
Where $RN=\mathbf{0}$

- The solution to the nullspace, when thinking of the Nullspace in block form then becomes:
$$
\begin{align*}
R\mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{0}
\\
\begin{bmatrix}
I & F\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{pivot} \\
x_{free}
\end{bmatrix}
&= \mathbf{0}
\\
x_{pivot}&=-F x_{free}
\end{align*}
$$

## 3.3 The Complete Solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$
- The complete solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is $x_{p} + x_n$; where $x_p$ is a particular solution and $x_n$ is any solution in the nullspace
- The particular solution can be found by setting the free variables to zero, then the pivot variables are read from $\mathbf{d}$ (if the matrix $R$ is in rref)
- Elimination on $\begin{bmatrix} A & \mathbf{b} \end{bmatrix}$ leads to $\begin{bmatrix} R & \mathbf{d} \end{bmatrix}$. Where by $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is equivalent to $R\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$
- $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ and  $R\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$ are solvable only when all zero rows of $R$ have zeros in $\mathbf{d}$
- When $R\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{d}$ is solvable, one very particular solution $x_p$ has all free variables equal to zero

- If $A$ is full column rank (i.e. $r=n$):
  1. All columns of $A$ are pivot columns
  2. No free variables
  3. $\mathbf{N}(A)= \{\mathbf{0}\}$
  4. If $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution there is only 1
- If $A$ is full row rank (i.e. $r=m$):
  1. All rows of $A$ have pivots; $R$ has no zero rows
  2. The column space is the whole space $\R^m$
  3. There are $n-r=n-m$ special solutions in the $\mathbf{N}(A)$
  4. If $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution for every $\mathbf{b}$

- Summary of 4 possibilities for linear equations by rank:
  1. Full Rank
      - $r=m$ and $r=n$
      - Square and invertible
      - $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has 1 solution
  2. Full Row Rank
      - $r=m$ and $r < n$
      - Short and wide
      - $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has $\infty$ solution
  3. Full Column Rank
      - $r<m$ and $r = n$
      - Tall and thin
      - $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has 0 or 1 solutions
  4. Not full rank
      - $r<m$ and $r < n$
      - $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has 0 or $\infty$ solutions
      
## 3.4 Independence, Basis and Dimension

- Linearly Independent: Vectors $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ are independent if $c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \dots + c_n v_n = 0$ only happens when $c_i=0$ $\forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ 
- Full column rank (independence): columns of $A$ are independent when: 
  1. Rank is $r=n$
  2. $n$ pivots and no free variables
  3. $\mathbf{N}(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$
- A set of vectors **span a space** if their linear combinations fill the space
- Basis: sequence of vectors with two properties:
  1. They are linearly independent
  2. They span the space
- The vectors $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ are a **basis for $\R^n$** exactly when they are the columns of an $n$ by $n$ invertible matrix
- Any set of $n$ vectors in $\R^n$ must be linearly dependent if $n>m$
- There are infinitely many different bases of $\R^n$
- The dimension of a space is the number of vectors in every basis
- The rank of a matrix equals the dimensions of the column space
- If the dimension of the space is $d$ and you have $d$ independent vectors; they will span the space
- Row Space of a matrix: is the subspace of $\R^n$ spanned by the rows
- Row Space (formula): $\mathbf{C}(A^{\intercal})$; i.e. the column space of $A^{\intercal}$
- The pivot columns of $A$ are a basis for its column space
- The pivot rows of $A$ are a basis for its row space
- If $v_1, \dots, v_m$ and $w_1, \dots, w_n$ are both bases for the same vector space, then $m=n$


## 3.5 Dimensions of the Four Subspaces

- Row space: $\mathbf{C}(A^{\intercal})$, a subspace of $\R^n$ with dimension $r$
- Column space: $\mathbf{C}(A)$ a subspace of $\R^m$ with dimension $r$
- Nullspace: $\mathbf{N}(A)$ a subspace of $\R^n$ with dimension $n-r$
- Left Nullspace: $\mathbf{N}(A^{\intercal})$ a subspace of $\R^m$ with dimension $m-r$
- The dimension of the row space is rank $r$; the nonzero rows of $R$ form a basis.
- The dimension of the column space is the rank $r$; the pivot columns form a basis
- The nullspace has dimension $n-r$; the special solutions form a basis
- Rank Theorem: The number of independent columns = the number of independent rows
- Every matrix with rank 1 is one column times one row: $A = \mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^{\intercal}$

### Graphs: Nodes, Edges

- Example:
![Network Graph](images/network_graph.png)
- The following matrix gives the network graph:
- Define a matrix with number of rows equal to the number of edges, columns the number of nodes
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
