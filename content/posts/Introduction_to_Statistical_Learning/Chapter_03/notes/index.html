<ul>
<li>Interaction: two or more variables interact to affect a third variable in a non additive manner, i.e. two variables interact to have an affect more than the sum of their parts</li>
<li>Simple Linear Regression (formula): <span class="math inline">\(Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon\)</span></li>
<li>2 Coefficients or parameters for Simple Linear Regression (SLR):
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0=\)</span> Intercept</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1=\)</span> slope</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SLR estimate (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y_i} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i\)</span></li>
<li>Residual: difference between the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th observed response and the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th response value predicted by our model</li>
<li>Residual (formula): <span class="math inline">\(e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i\)</span></li>
<li>Residual Sum of Squares: the sum of squared residuals for all observations <span class="math inline">\(i=1, 2, \dots, n\)</span> a.k.a. <span class="math inline">\(RSS\)</span></li>
<li>Residual Sum of Squares (formula):
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(RSS = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \dots + e_n^2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(RSS = (y_1 - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_2)^2 + \dots + (y_n - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_n)^2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Least Squares: an approach to estimate or choose values of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> by minimizing the <span class="math inline">\(RSS\)</span></li>
<li>Least Squares coefficient estimates:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expressions for sample means:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} {y_i}={\overline{y}}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} {x_i}={\overline{x}}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bias: Tendency of a statistic to over or under estimate a parameter</li>
<li>Standard Error of a statistic: is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution</li>
<li>Standard Error of the mean (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var}(\hat{\mu})=\text{SE}(\hat{\mu})^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\text{SE}(\hat{\mu})=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>; where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = # of observations taken from statistical population and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the standard deviation of the population</li>
<li>Standard Deviation of a population: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span></li>
<li>Standard Deviation of a sample: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span></li>
<li>Standard Deviation of the mean (a.k.a. standard error of mean): <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span></li>
<li>Estimator of Standard Deviation of the mean (colloqually called standard error): <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span></li>
<li>Standard Error of SLR Intercept: <span class="math inline">\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)^2=\sigma^2 \left [ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{x}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2} \right ]\)</span>; where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2=\text{Var}(\epsilon)\)</span> and the errors <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> are uncorrelated</li>
<li>Standard Error of SLR Slope: <span class="math inline">\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)^2=\frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\)</span>; where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2=\text{Var}(\epsilon)\)</span> and the errors <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> are uncorrelated</li>
<li>How do the values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> affect the size of <span class="math inline">\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)\)</span>? The larger the spread of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> values (i.e. further from <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>) the smaller the standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span></li>
<li>What happens if <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=0\)</span>? Then <span class="math inline">\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)=\text{SE}(\hat{\mu})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_0=\bar{y}\)</span></li>
<li>Residual Standard Error (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\text{RSE}=\sqrt{\text{RSS}/n-2}\)</span></li>
<li>How should SE of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> be depicted if we are estimating <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>? <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\text{SE}}(\hat{\beta}_1)\)</span> to indicate that an estimate has been made; i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \approx \text{RSE}\)</span>, but generally for simplicity of notation this extra “hat” is dropped</li>
<li>Confidence Interval: Range of values such taht with a specific probability the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter</li>
<li>Approximate 95% CI of SLR coeff:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1 \pm 2 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_0 \pm 2 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hypothesis Test: a method of statistical inference used to determine possible conclusion from two different and likely conflicting hypothesis</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis for SLR: There is no relationship between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\hat{\beta}_1=0\)</span></li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis for SLR: There is some relationship between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_a: \hat{\beta}_1 \ne 0\)</span></li>
<li>t-statistic: <span class="math inline">\(t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - 0}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)}\)</span></li>
<li>t-distribution: any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arise when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population’s standard deviation is unknown.</li>
<li>Who developed the t-distribution? English statistician William Sealy Gosset under the pseudonym “Student”</li>
<li>Why was the t-distribution first published under the pseudonym of “student”? Since William Sealy Gosset worked at Guinness at the time his employer didn’t want competitors to know their steps</li>
<li>p-value: probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results observed, under assumption that the null hypothesis is correct</li>
<li>Residual Standard Error: average amount response will deviate from true regression line; other words, if <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> were known perfectly; RSE is an estimate of standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\frac{TSS-RSS}{TSS}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}\)</span></li>
<li>TSS (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2\)</span></li>
<li>Total Sum of Squares: TSS; Total variance in <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>; amount of variability inherent in response prior to regression performed</li>
<li>RSS: Amount of variability left unexplained after regression</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>: proportion of variability in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that can be explained by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(R^2=r^2\)</span> in SLR</li>
<li>Correlation between <span class="math inline">\((X,Y)\)</span> (formula):<span class="math inline">\(Corr(X,Y)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}\)</span></li>
<li>For SLR it can be shown that <span class="math inline">\(R^2=r^2\)</span></li>
<li>MLR Estimate (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_i=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 x_1+\hat{\beta}_2 x_2+\dots+\hat{\beta}_px_p\)</span>
RSS for MLR (formula): <span class="math inline">\(RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n(y_1 - \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1 x_{i1} - \hat{\beta}_2 x_{i2} - \dots - \hat{\beta}_p x_{ip})^2\)</span></li>
<li>Null Hypothesis for MLR (formula): <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\hat{\beta}_1=\hat{\beta}_2=\dots=\hat{\beta}_p=0\)</span></li>
<li>Alternative Hypothesis for MLR: At least one <span class="math inline">\(B_j\)</span> is non-zero</li>
<li>F-Statistic (formula): <span class="math inline">\(F=\frac{(TSS-RSS)/p}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\)</span></li>
<li>Value of F-Statistic if Null hypothesis is true: 1, because
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E[(TSS - RSS)/p]=\sigma^2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E[RSS/(n-p-1)]=\sigma^2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Value of F-Statistic if Alternate Hypothesis is true: &gt; 1, because
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E[(TSS - RSS)/p]&gt;\sigma^2\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Null Hypothesis MLR for subset of coefficients: <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\hat{\beta}_{p-q+1}=\hat{\beta}_{p-q+2}=\dots=\hat{\beta}_p=0\)</span>; where for convenience we have put the variables chosen for omission at the end of the list
and create a model with the <span class="math inline">\(p-q\)</span> variables</li>
<li>F-Statistic for subset model: <span class="math inline">\(F=\frac{(RSS_0-RSS)/q}{RSS/(n-p-1)}\)</span></li>
<li>Variable Selection: The task of determining which predictor is associated w/ the response, in order to cull the field of predictors</li>
<li>With regard to variable selection; if a model as <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> variables how many possible models are there? <span class="math inline">\(2^p\)</span> because each p can be in or out</li>
<li>Name 4 statistics that can be used to judge the quality of a model:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Mallow’s Cp</li>
<li>Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)</li>
<li>Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)</li>
<li>Adjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></li>
</ol></li>
<li>What are the 4 questions to ask when examining a MLR model?
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is at least one of the predictors important?</li>
<li>Do all the predictors help explain <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>? or only a subset</li>
<li>How well does the model fit the data</li>
<li>Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Forward Selection:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Begin with a null model (intercept only)</li>
<li>Fit <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> simple linear regression models</li>
<li>Add to the null model the variable that results in the lowest <span class="math inline">\(RSS\)</span></li>
<li>Fit (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-1) 2 variable models</li>
<li>Add to the working model the variable that results in lowest <span class="math inline">\(RSS\)</span> for 2 variable model</li>
<li>Continue until stopping rule</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Backward Selection:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start with all variables in the model</li>
<li>Remove variable with largest p-value (i.e. the variable that is least statistically significant)</li>
<li>New (p-1) variable model is fit</li>
<li>Variable with largest p-value is removed</li>
<li>Continue until stopping rule</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Mixed Selection: Combination of forward and backward selection
<ul>
<li>Start as in forward selection with null model and add variables that provide best fit 1-by-1</li>
<li>Check p-values for all model variables; if one rises above a threshold it is removed</li>
<li>Continue until all variables in the model have sufficiently low p-value and all variables outside model would have large p-values if added</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Backward selection cannot be used if <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;n\)</span></li>
<li>Forward selection can always be used</li>
<li>Forward selection is a greedy approach and might include variables early that later become redundant</li>
<li>Two of the most common numerical measures of model fit are the <span class="math inline">\(RSE\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></li>
<li>For simple regression it can be shown that <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(r^2=(\text{Cor}(X,Y))^2\)</span></li>
<li>For multiple regression it can be shwon that <span class="math inline">\(R^2=(\text{Cor}(Y,\hat{Y}))^2\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> always increases when more variables are added to the model</li>
<li>General formula for <span class="math inline">\(RSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-p-1}RSS}\)</span></li>
<li>3 Sources of error when making a prediction:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Coefficient estimates <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1, \dots, \hat{\beta}_p\)</span> are estimates for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p\)</span> or rather the least squares plane: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_i=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 x_1+\hat{\beta}_2 x_2+\dots+\hat{\beta}_px_p\)</span> is an estimate for the true population plane: <span class="math inline">\(f(X)=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p\)</span>; The inaccuracy in the coefficient estimates is related to reducible error, computing a confidence interval can help determine how close <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> is to <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span></li>
<li>Assuming a linear model for <span class="math inline">\(f(X)\)</span> is almost always an approximation, so an additional source of potentially reducible error is model bias</li>
<li>Even if <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p\)</span> were known there is a random error <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> that is irreducible error; i.e. prediction intervals are wider than confidence intervals as they have reducible error as well as irreducible error</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Dummy Variable: a dichotomouse numeric variable that represents categorical data, typically 1 represents the presence of a qualitative attribute, and 0 represents the absence</li>
<li>If qualitative predictor has more than two levels then additional dummy variables need to be added</li>
<li>The “level” with no dummy variable is known as the baseline</li>
<li>Additive assumption for linear model: association between predictor <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> and response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> doesn’t depend on other predictors</li>
<li>Linearity Assumption for linear model: change in response <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> associated with one-unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> is constant regardless of value of <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span></li>
<li>Interaction term - the effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable; a.k.a. “synergy”</li>
<li>Interaction term (formula):
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
Y&amp;=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_1 X_2 + \epsilon\\
&amp;=\beta_0+(\beta_1 + \beta_3 X_2) X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon\\
&amp;=\beta_0+\tilde{\beta}_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon\\
\end{split}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\beta}_1 = \beta_1 + \beta_3 X_2\)</span> and is a function of <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> and the interaction between <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is no longer constant</li>
<li>Hierarchical principle: if we include an interaction in the model, we should also include the main effects, even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant</li>
<li>Polynomial regression: extension of a simple linear model by adding extra predictors obtained by raising each of the original predictors to a power</li>
<li>6 Common potential problems with linear regression:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Non-linearity of response-predictor relationships</li>
<li>Correlation of error terms</li>
<li>Non-constant variance of error terms</li>
<li>Outliers</li>
<li>High-leverage points</li>
<li>Collinearity</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How can you assess the non-linearity of the data? Residual plots exhibit a clear non-linear pattern</li>
<li>Residual plot: plotting residuals versus <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_i\)</span></li>
<li>How can you correct non-linearity in the data? by performing a non-linear transformation of the predictors, such as <span class="math inline">\(log(X)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{X}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(X^2\)</span></li>
<li>Uncorrelated error terms: If <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is positive it provides little or no information about the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i+1}\)</span></li>
<li>If the error terms are correlated then the estimated standard errors will tend to underestimate the true standard errors</li>
<li>In short if error terms are correlated, we may have overconfidence in our model</li>
<li>Homoscedastic: error terms are the same across all values of the independent variables</li>
<li>Heteroscedastic: error terms differ across values of an independent variable</li>
<li>2 Possible solutions to heteroscedasticity:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Transform the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> such as <span class="math inline">\(log(Y)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{Y}\)</span></li>
<li>Weighted least squares</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Weighted Least Squares: knowledge of the variance of observations is incorporated into the regression</li>
<li>Outliers: a point is an outlier if <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is far from value predicted by the model</li>
<li>studentized residuals: residual divided by it’s estimated standard error</li>
<li>Outlier identification: if studentized residuals are greater than 3</li>
<li>What happens to measures of model fit if there are outliers in the data? <span class="math inline">\(RSE\)</span> increases and <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> decreases</li>
<li>High leverage points: a measure of how far away the independent variable values of an observation are compared to those of other observations; in summary: unusual value of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>; fairly easy to see in SLR, more difficult in MLR</li>
<li>Leverage Statistic or Hat value (formula): <span class="math inline">\(h_i = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^{\prime}-\bar{x})^2}\)</span></li>
<li>Average Leverage (formula): <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(p+1)}{n}\)</span></li>
<li>Collinearity: a situation where 2 or more predictor variables are closely related to one another</li>
<li>Why is collinearity a problem?: It can be difficult to determine individual effects of collinear variables on the response</li>
<li>How does collinearity affect the standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span>? standard errors for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> grow</li>
<li>How does collinearity affect the t-statistic?: since the t-statistic is calculated by dividing <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_j\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\text{SE}({\hat{\beta}_j})\)</span> so because the standard error increases the resulting t-statistic is reduced; therefore we may fail to reject the null hypothesis</li>
<li>What is the Power of a hypothesis test? the probability of correctly detecting a non-zero coefficient</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
