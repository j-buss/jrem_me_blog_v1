My name is Jeremy Buss and throughout my life I have been inquisitive.
In elementary school this passion took the shape as a love of reading. I would spend most evenings after school reading anything I could get my hands on.
I especially loved reading stories about people and the impact they made. 
It felt like I had a backstage pass to the lives of influential individuals.

As I progressed through high school and into college this inquisitive nature 
led me to study physics and mathematics. Attending 
[University Wisconsin Oshkosh](https://uwosh.edu/) gave me the opportunity to 
perform astrophysics research at some exotic destinations and become a [published researcher](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fsearch%2F%3Fquery%3DBuss%252C%2BJeremy%26searchtype%3Dauthor%26abstracts%3Dshow%26order%3D-announced_date_first%26size%3D50&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNElu2OBAQWkc3y39AJJWORXxcqJQA). 
 
In the recent past my interests have led me to data and cloud computing. With the tools available in cloud anyone can build systems that were unimaginable just a few years ago. 

This site is a personal journey to hold me accountable to live my two guiding principles:

1. Explore
2. Share
